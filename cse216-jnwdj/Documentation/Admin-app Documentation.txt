If you get a null pointer exception from mvn exec:java, you need to set the environment variable 
DATABASE_URL = postgres://zlaennwxsskfdj:cecfea3727b02543045f3779ef412fcf1e31a121325e45a448a7d227a6f61bd6@ec2-54-235-92-244.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d2tdob33qt6k0f

This value is also available through “heroku config” if you’ve downloaded heroku CLI (tutorial 8)

Most of the operations you would want to do are now available, (check the commands with ?).  But you can not change the uid of a message (this may or may not be desirable).
